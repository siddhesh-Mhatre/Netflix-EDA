# Netflix-EDA
In this project, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a structured dataset containing information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix from 2018 to 2021. We will use Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations and graphs that help us understand the data better.

The goal of this EDA is to practice our Python skills and gain insights into the Netflix dataset. We will load, inspect, wrangle, explore and draw conclusions from the data.

Stay tuned for updates as we dive into the world of Netflix!
